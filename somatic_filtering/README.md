Somatic variant filtering
=========================

Matt Eldridge made [slides](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/cruk-summer-school-2017/Day3/somatic_snv_filtering.html) on problems around small somatic variant calling and filtering. We summarized the filtering ideas into a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xbz4nW76mofKb9ym3C725W035qkA7JuUu8_FvYSCOT0/edit#gid=0), where for problem and idea we provide a corresponding solution (if available) used in [CaVEMan](https://github.com/cancerit/cgpCaVEManWrapper), [bcbio](http://bcb.io/2015/03/05/cancerval/) and [VarDict](vardict_filtering.md).
