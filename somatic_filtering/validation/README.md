Small variant validation
========================

This document summarizes tools and datasets that can be used for variant calling comparison with truth set and visualization.

## Tools

* [rtgeval](https://github.com/lh3/rtgeval) - wrapper for RTG's vcfeval.

* [Concordance between variant callers](https://github.com/vladsaveliev/concordance)

* [JS-based Venn diagrams for BED and VCF files](https://github.com/vladsaveliev/Venn)
